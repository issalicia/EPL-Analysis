# EPL-Analysis
In this project, as the data chief of an English Premier League (EPL) sports organization, we selected the PLSquadPassingStats 2022-2023 dataset. 
Using this dataset and Tableau, our goal is to derive actionable insights for better performance in the EPL. By leveraging data analytics and building visualizations, we aim to present to stakeholders the optimal playing style the team should adopt to be more successful next season. 
Success is defined as making it to the Champions League (top 4) or qualifying for European competitions (top 7). We are focused on developing a more effective playing style to win more games and achieve a top 7 finish.
